This is a simple CRUD app. To start the app, open it in your terminal and cd into the main directory. Type 'yarn start' and press enter.

The app performs CRUD logic, Creating users, editin and deleting. At this point it is not connected to the database which would allow us to Read the data from it. This is a simple code to serve as a quick referrence.

Database will be added soon, and routes/node.js logic will follow.
